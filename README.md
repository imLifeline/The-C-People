Thats a lot and theres more omfg imma stop this here

## Strings and Variables
### Strings
In Python we would do this:
```python
string = "Hello"
```
That would create a string with a value of "Hello". 
In C we have to do it a bit differently. 
Strings are a sequence of characters. <br>
They are declared like this:
```c
char string[10];
```
this creates a string with a length of 10 characters. Which we can later use to assign a value to.<br>
You can also initialize it with a value like this:
```c
char string[10] = "Hello";
```
This creates a string with a length of 10 characters and a value of "Hello". <br>
You can also do this:
```c
char string[] = "Hello";
```
This creates a string with a length of 6 characters and a value of "Hello". <br>
The length is 6 because the compiler automatically adds a null character at the end of the string.

### Variables
Variables are used to store values. <br>
They are declared like this:
```c
int x;
```
This creates an integer variable called x. <br>
You can also initialize it with a value like this:
```c
int x = 5;
```
This creates an integer variable called x with a value of 5. <br>
You can also do this:
```c
int x;
x = 5;
```
This creates an integer variable called x and thn later set the value to 5.

### Integers
Integers are whole numbers. <br>
They are declared like this:
```c
int x;
```
This creates an integer variable called x. <br>
You can also initialize it with a value like this:
```c
int x = 5;
```
This creates an integer variable called x with a value of 5. <br>
You can also do this:
```c
int x;
x = 5;
```
This creates an integer variable called x and thn later set the value to 5.

# Functions
## Basic Functions

### printf
This function is used to print text to the console. It is declared like this:
```c
printf("Hello World!"); // This prints "Hello World!" to the console
```
### scanf
This one is to get input from the user, just like input() from python. It is declared like this:
```c
int x; //We define the variable x first because scanf needs a variable to store the input
scanf("%d", &x); // This gets input from the user and stores it in x
```

In Python we would do this:
```python
x = input()
```
But in C we have to define the variable first and then use scanf to get the input and store it in the variable.
